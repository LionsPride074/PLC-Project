Hello and welcome to my Project for Programming Language Concepts!

This project was focused on creating a fairly simple Python IDE with the means to color code all aspect of your code (i.e. class names, method names, etc.)

PyQt5 and Qscintilla were paramount to making this work, and will need to be installed on your machine (using pip install) if you wish to run this.

Thank you for taking the time to look as this project and have a great rest of your day!
